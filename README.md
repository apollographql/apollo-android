This is a Gradle plugin and set of libraries that generate Java code based on a GraphQL schema and query documents.
The plugin uses `apollo-codegen` under the hood.

**Still a work in progress. Please check back later!**

## Usage

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.apollostack.android:gradle-plugin:0.0.1'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.apollostack.android.gradle.ApolloPlugin'
```
