/**
 * An immutable object that may contain a non-null reference to another object. Each instance of this type either
 * contains a non-null reference, or contains nothing (in which case we say that the reference is "absent"); it is never
 * said to "contain `null`".
 *
 *
 * A non-null `Optional<T>` reference can be used as a replacement for a nullable `T` reference. It
 * allows you to represent "a `T` that must be present" and a "a `T` that might be absent" as two distinct
 * types in your program, which can aid clarity.
 *
 *
 * Some uses of this class include
 *
 *   * As a method return type, as an alternative to returning `null` to indicate that no value was available
 *  * To distinguish between "unknown" (for example, not present in a map) and "known to have no value" (present in the
 * map, with value `Optional.absent()`)  * To wrap nullable references for storage in a collection that does not
 * support `null` (though there are
 * [
 * several other approaches to this](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/LivingWithNullHostileCollections) that should be considered first)
 *
 *
 * A common alternative to using this class is to find or create a
 * suitable [null
 * object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) for the type in question.
 *
 *
 * This class is not intended as a direct analogue of any existing "option" or "maybe" construct from other
 * programming environments, though it may bear some similarities.
 *
 *
 * **Comparison to `java.util.Optional` (JDK 8 and higher):** A new `Optional` class was added for
 * Java 8. The two classes are extremely similar, but incompatible (they cannot share a common supertype). *All*
 * known differences are listed either here or with the relevant methods below.
 *
 *   * This class is serializable; `java.util.Optional` is not.  * `java.util.Optional` has the
 * additional methods `ifPresent`, `filter`, `flatMap`, and `orElseThrow`.  * `java.util`
 * offers the primitive-specialized versions `OptionalInt`, `OptionalLong` and `OptionalDouble`, the
 * use of which is recommended; Guava does not have these.
 *
 *
 * **There are no plans to deprecate this class in the foreseeable future.** However, we do gently recommend that
 * you prefer the new, standard Java class whenever possible.
 *
 *
 * See the Guava User Guide article on
 * [
 * using `Optional`](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained#optional).
 *
 * @param <T> the type of instance that can be contained. `Optional` is naturally covariant on this type, so it is
 * safe to cast an `Optional<T>` to `Optional<S>` for any supertype `S` of `T`.

   *
   *
   * Note about generics: The signature `public T or(T defaultValue)` is overly restrictive. However, the ideal
   * signature, `public <S super T> S or(S)`, is not legal Java. As a result, some sensible operations involving
   * subtypes are compile errors:
   * <pre>   `Optional<Integer> optionalInt = getSomeOptionalInt();
   * Number value = optionalInt.or(0.5); // error
   *
   * FluentIterable<? extends Number> numbers = getSomeNumbers();
   * Optional<? extends Number> first = numbers.first();
   * Number value = first.or(0.5); // error`</pre>
   *
   *
   * As a workaround, it is always safe to cast an `Optional<? extends T>` to `Optional<T>`. Casting
   * either of the above example `Optional` instances to `Optional<Number>` (where `Number` is the
   * desired output type) solves the problem:
   * <pre>   `Optional<Number> optionalInt = (Optional) getSomeOptionalInt();
   * Number value = optionalInt.or(0.5); // fine
   *
   * FluentIterable<? extends Number> numbers = getSomeNumbers();
   * Optional<Number> first = (Optional) numbers.first();
   * Number value = first.or(0.5); // fine`</pre>
   *
   *
   * **Comparison to `java.util.Optional`:** this method is similar to Java 8's `Optional.orElse`, but
   * will not accept `null` as a `defaultValue` ([.orNull] must be used instead). As a result, the
   * value returned by this method is guaranteed non-null, which is not the case for the `java.util` equivalent.
