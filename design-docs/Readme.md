## Design docs

This is Apollo Android documentation for how things work under the hood. The user-facing documentation about how to use Apollo Android is available at https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/.

This internal documentation is work in progress. It is used for brainstorming/communication but might be lagging sometimes, feel free to send PRs! That being said, you'll find here:

* [Compiler.md](Compiler.md): a high level overview of the different stages of the GraphQL compiler
* [Threading.md](Threading.md): thoughts about threading and concurrency, especially in the K/N world  
* [Glossary.md](Glossary.md): a list of terms used throughout the repo
