 * <p>ApolloPrefetch is an abstraction for a request that has been prepared for execution. It represents a single
 * request/response pair and cannot be executed twice, though it can be cancelled. It fetches the graph response from
 * the server on successful completion but <b>doesn't</b> inflate the response into models. Instead it stores the raw
 * response in the request/response cache and defers the parsing to a later time.</p>
 *
 *
 * <p>Use this object for use cases when the data needs to be fetched, but is not required for immediate consumption.
 * e.g.background update/syncing.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: In order to execute the request again, call the {@link ApolloPrefetch#clone()} method which creates a new
 * {@link ApolloPrefetch} object.</p>
