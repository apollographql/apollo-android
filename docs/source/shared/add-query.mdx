Put your first GraphQL query in a `.graphql` file, in the same directory as your downloaded schema: `app/src/main/graphql/com/example/LaunchDetails.graphql`

```graphql:title=src/main/graphql/com/example/LaunchDetails.graphql
query LaunchDetails($id:ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    id
    site
    mission {
      name
      missionPatch(size:LARGE)
    }
  }
}
```

Now build your project, which will generate the models. Either click the green triangle in Android Studio or run the following:

```bash:title=(shell)
./gradlew build
```
