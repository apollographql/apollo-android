title: Gradle configuration options
---

Apollo Android comes with logical defaults that will work for the majority of use cases. If you're getting started, see the [getting started guide](./get-started/) for an overview of the most common options. This page describes the different options individually.

A complete configuration block with multiple services will look like this:

```groovy:title=build.gradle
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    sourceFolder = "starwars"
    rootPackageName = "com.starwars"
  }
  service("githunt") {
    sourceFolder = "githunt"
    rootPackageName = "com.starwars"
  }
}
```
